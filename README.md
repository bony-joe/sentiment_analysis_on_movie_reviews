# sentiment_analysis_on_movie_reviews
I developed 6 Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, SVM &amp; Decision Tree) to perform Sentiment Analysis on a set of movie reviews. The datas are pre-processed and the models are tuned to get the best results. The Models are then evaluated both by Pipeline and their Metrics Scores.
