# sentiment_analysis_on_movie_reviews
I developed 6 Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and SVM) to perform Sentiment Analysis on a set of movie reviews. The data are pre-processed and the models are tuned to get the best results. The Models are then evaluated using both Pipeline and Metrics Scores.
