# sentiment_analysis_on_movie_reviews
I developed 6 Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree and SVM) to perform Sentiment Analysis on a set of movie reviews. The datas are pre-processed and the models are tuned to get the best results. The Models are then evaluated both by their Pipeline and Metrics Scores.
